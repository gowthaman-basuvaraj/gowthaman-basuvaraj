# Hi, I'm Gowthaman 👋

**Full-Stack Engineer** building production-grade systems with innovative architectures.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

### Trade Boxer - Dynamic Algorithmic Trading Platform
A zero-downtime trading system for Indian equity markets where strategies are hot-loadable Groovy scripts.

**The Innovation**: Treating code as configuration data.
- **Hot-loadable scripts** - Update strategies without redeployment
- **Dynamic configuration** - Users configure parameters, not code
- **State persistence** - Multi-day strategies that remember context
- **Auto-scaling** - One algo → entire stock indices

**Tech**: Kotlin • Groovy • PostgreSQL • Redis • Zerodha API • TA4J • Vue.js


### MyBaaS - Multi-Tenant Backend as a Service
A flexible BaaS platform that lets developers spin up production-ready backends without writing server code.

**The Innovation**: Schema-driven API generation with automatic multi-tenancy.
- **Dynamic schema** - Define data models via UI, get REST APIs instantly
- **Built-in multi-tenancy** - Tenant isolation at database and API level
- **Auto-generated APIs** - CRUD operations with filtering, pagination, validation
- **Authentication & Authorization** - Role-based access control out of the box
- **Real-time subscriptions** - WebSocket support for live data updates

**Tech**: Kotlin • PostgreSQL • Javalin • React.js • WebSocket • JWT

## 🎯 What Makes My Work Different

### 1. **Runtime Flexibility**
I build systems that adapt without recompilation. Scripts, rules, and workflows stored as data.

### 2. **Production-Grade**
Real money, real users, real uptime requirements. I build for production from day one.

### 3. **Full-Stack Ownership**
Database schema → API design → frontend UX. I ship complete features.

### 4. **Domain Complexity**
Finance, trading, compliance, multi-tenant systems. I thrive in complex business domains.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> **"Configuration over code. Data over deployment."**

The best systems are flexible without being fragile. They let users configure behavior without touching source code.

Examples:
- Trading strategies as Groovy scripts (not hardcoded)
- Business rules in database (not if-else chains)
- Workflows as JSON (not service classes)
